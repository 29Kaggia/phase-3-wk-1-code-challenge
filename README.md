## Introduction

This repository contains solutions to three coding challenges: time conversion, integer check, and constant value calculations. Each challenge is implemented as a separate Python script.

## Challenges

### 1. Time Conversion

#### Problem Statement

Given a 12-hour time in the format "hh:mm am/pm", convert it to 24-hour time format.

#### Solution

The `time_conversion.py` script contains the implementation of this challenge.

### 2. Integer Check

#### Problem Statement

Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, determine whether exactly two of them are positive.

#### Solution

The `integer_check.py` script contains the implementation of this challenge.

### 3. Consonant Value

#### Problem Statement

Given a lowercase string that consists of alphabetic characters only, find the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".

#### Solution

The `consonant_value.py` script contains the implementation of this challenge.
